	<h2>Creator</h2>
	<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>We created this website in order to provide you a platform where you can view and upload any kind of paper. We are providing our online medical diagnostic services for free which may help doctors and other researchers to find the help they need from our backend AI algorithms. Such as if someone wants to check whether an image has the characteristics of a specific disease, he/she can upload the image at the diagnostic terminal and check the results. There will be different terminals for different diseases and the type of detection they want such as either segmentation or classification into various categories</p>
		<p>Our input type can be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unstructured data: Image</li>
			<li>Structuresd data: List of various properties and characteristics in terms of values</li>
			<li>Size: Input size will be fixed but you can upload at any resolution you want which will get automatically resized</li>
		</ul>
